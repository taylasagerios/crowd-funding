# crowd-funding
Crowd Funding is an app to help a user see a list of current projects that are seeking funding. In this app you can create an account. Once you have cerated an account you can post your own projects that need funding.

For this mini-project we used Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, Handlebars.js, and MVC architecture.
